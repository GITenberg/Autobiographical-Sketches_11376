description: '"Annie Wood Besant (1847-1933) was a problematic and notorious figure
  in Victorian England, questioning and then breaking from the Anglican Church to
  become an atheist, women''s rights advocate, and Freethinker. As editor of her own
  journal, Our Corner, she responded to inquiries about her life experiences by serializing
  her life story, which was published in 1885. After providing a vivid account of
  her trial, along with Charles Bradlaugh, for the right to publish birth control
  literature, Besant recounts her heartbreaking trial for custody of her daughter.'
